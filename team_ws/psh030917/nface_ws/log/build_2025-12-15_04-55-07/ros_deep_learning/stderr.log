[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findjetson-inference.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "jetson-inference", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "jetson-inference"
  with any of the following names:

    jetson-inferenceConfig.cmake
    jetson-inference-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "jetson-inference" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "jetson-inference_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "jetson-inference" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
